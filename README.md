# fellowship_ai_challenge

This challenge question has multiple goals to be achieved.
1. Use transfer learning to train a ResNet-50 model on stanford cars dataset.
2. Achieve test accuracy scores as close to best achieved accuracy scores as possible ( in this case, around 90% is the goal)
3. Test how normalization and image transformations effect how well the model learns.

This jupyter notebook was run on kaggle virtual environment and uses the copy of official stanford dataset directly available on the kaggle platform.
